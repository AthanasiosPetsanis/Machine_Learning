# Introduction

This repository is for some of my projects and experimentations with Machine Learning. <br>
Right now I have included the OpenAI Gym enviroments


## OpenAI Gym

For general information about what OpenAI Gym is you can refer here: [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml) <br>
For the purpose of running all notebooks (.ipynb) files you will first and foremost need to install Gym. 
More information on how to install Gym found here: [Gym Github repository](https://github.com/openai/gym)

### How to Run
After that, you're ready to run any of the 'OpenAI Gym' notebooks I have.
> **Note:** That is assuming you already have the Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras libraries
